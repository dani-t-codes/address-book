# Address Book

#### Epicodus Practice with Object-Oriented Javascript, Epicodus Intermediate JS, 11.1.20

#### Danielle Thompson

## Description

_This is a multi-lesson project practicing how to build an address book app to store contact info for friends. `Contact` objects will encapsulate each contact's data, as each contact will have multiple properties._

_The address book app will serve as a mock database, but can not actually function as one. As it is a mock database, global variables, while normally avoided, I want to be able to access the data inside. For this project only, if a variable is meant to represent a potential database, global variable is OK. Otherwise, they will be avoided._

## Technologies used

_{Bootstrap - yes, include libraries too!}_
_{jQuery}_
_Javascript_
